# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
In this project, the pixels of a road in images are labeled using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

Requirements for this project are listed in [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view).

### Setup
The following freameworks and packages are used:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
